I used radium for advanced css features(using media queries and ) in my app, by installing radium
--->npm install --save radium
after that I import radium to my files for using radium features
--->import Radium from 'radium'
***IMpo:when I want to use radium for any components that I we need to wrap our component like this :
--->export default Radium(APP) [App is the name of the component where I want to use radium features and I imported radium]

{To understand more look at person and App component}
--------------------------------------
when I want to use a CSS pseudo like (:hover) {it means anything like this }
{it is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). }

I should use it as string like this ':hover';
when I want to have css :
const style = {
    ':hover' : {
        backgroundColor: 'yellow',
        color: 'black'
    }
}

{before return I can write down style :)} (if it is class component I can write it down inside of render
if it is functional component it is before return)
-----------------------------------------
when I want to use queries I should write down query inside of string : 
const style = {
        '@media (min-width: 500px)': {
            width: '450px'
        }
    };

**IMPo:when I want to use media queries I should use a built in component <StyleRoot> 
I need to import it at first {import {StyleRoot} from 'radium'} and after that I need to wrap 
all of my codes inside of the return with this component.
{In the root component}
